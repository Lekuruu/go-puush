    <p>{{ .Config.Service.Name }} has been running out of our pockets since 2014 (since paypal deactivated our account, classifying us as a "file sharing service", against their terms of service). With an ever-increasing userbase, the costs involved in keeping {{ .Config.Service.Name }} running have escalated beyond $1000/month.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We do not have the spare time to maintain this service to a point we would be willing to consider other means of receiving money (such as Patreon), but at the same time are financially unable to continue supporting growth of the service.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As such, we have made the decision to disable new user registrations for the time being. <b>Existing users will be unaffected by this change for now</b> (given fair use of the service).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thanks for enjoying {{ .Config.Service.Name }}!</p>
